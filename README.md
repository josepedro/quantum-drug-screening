# Quantum Drug Screening

The need for better drug screening approaches is very high. We present a pipeline that will help with the screening process. Based on quantum semi-empirical computations, we try to score the interaction of different candidate molecules with a macro-molecule.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
MOPAC 2016 - you need to get a license for this from http://openmopac.net/MOPAC2016.html
MGLTools (already included in the repo for unix environment)
Autodesk Vina (already included for unix environment)
OpenBabel and pybel (best to install it through anaconda)
```

## Example of pipeline

Pipeline.ipynb has an example of how to use the pipeline to get the necessary scores

#### Example of molecules

The 'candidates' folder has example of molecules, while target has the main macromolecule in different formats
